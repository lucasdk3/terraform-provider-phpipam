This repository holds a external plugin for a [Terraform][1] provider to manage
resources within [PHPIPAM][2], an open source IP address management system.

## About PHPIPAM

[PHPIPAM][2] is an open source IP address management system written in PHP. It
has an evolving [API][3] that allows for the management and lookup of data that
has been entered into the system. Through our Go integration
[phpipam-sdk-go][4], we have been able to take this API and integrate it into
Terraform, allowing for the management and lookup of sections, VLANs, subnets,
and IP addresses, entirely within Terraform.

## Data Source and Resource Documentation

Please see the [documentation directory](./docs/index.md) for how to use this
provider.

## Building

The provider's executable files are hosted on the [Terraform Repository][8] and are
ready to use without additional assembly.
See the [Plugin Basics][5] page of the Terraform docs to see how to plunk this
into your config. Check the [releases page][6] of this repo to get releases for
Linux, OS X, and Windows.

How to build provider;

Example for Rocky Linux 8:

Build from repo:

```sh
sudo yum install golang git
sudo mkdir -p $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
cd $HOME/development/terraform-providers/
git clone https://github.com/lord-kyron/terraform-provider-phpipam
# In some cases need execute go install twice
go install
go build
cp terraform-provider-phpipam ~/.terraform.d/plugins/local.dev/phpipam/{version}/{os_platform}/
```

## Unit tests

Requirements:

1. Ready for usage phpIPAM instance
2. Created Custom fields for IP address, subnets, vlans objects inside phpIPAM
   should be created ext custom fields:
   Custom IP addresses fields:
     - CustomTestAddresses varchar(30)
     - CustomTestAddresses2 varchar(30)
   Custom Subnets fields:
     - CustomTestSubnets varchar(30)
     - CustomTestSubnets2 varchar(30)
   Custom VLAN fields:
     - CustomTestVLANs varchar(30)
3. Exported environment variable with phpIPAM credentials. Example:

```sh
export PHPIPAM_APP_ID="terraform"
export PHPIPAM_ENDPOINT_ADDR="http://10.10.0.1/api"
export PHPIPAM_PASSWORD="password"
export PHPIPAM_USER_NAME="Admin"
```

To start unit test exec next command:

```sh
make testacc
```

Example unit test results:

```sh
go clean -testcache; TF_ACC=1 go test -v ./plugin/providers/phpipam -run="TestAcc"
